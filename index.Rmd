Greetings! My name is Paula, and I am a thrid-year PhD candidate at UMich. I work with Dr. Anne Draelos and I currently work on using bayesian optimization to efficiently characterize high-dimensional neural tuning curves in real-time calcium imaging.  

I earned my M.S degree in Biostatistics from Columbia University, B.A degree in Data Science and B.S degree in Brain and Cognitive Science, Summa Cum Laude, from the University of Rochester (Meliora!). <br><br>

For my **researching and teaching** experience, please click the *Experience tab* on the top right. 

In my free time, I enjoy making daytrip plans, exploring any cities, and making food journals. I uploaded some of my **journals** about NYC restaurants to the *Paula's fWUd tab*. I know... I konw that was a long time ago, I'm trying my best to catch up :]

Enjoy exploring! <br><br>
