Greetings! My name is Paula, currently a second-year MS student in Biostatistics at Columbia University. I earned my B.A degree in Data Science and B.S degree in Brain and Cognitive Science, Summa Cum Laude, from University of Rochester (Meliora!). <br><br>

You can explore some of the **projects** I did during my time here at Columbia. 

For my **researching and teaching** experience, please click the *Experience tab* on the top right. 

In my free time, I enjoy food hunting and making journals. I uploaded some of my **journals** about NYC restaurants to the *Paula's fWUd tab*. 

Enjoy exploring! <br><br>
