Greetings! My name is Paula, currently a first-year PhD student at UMich. I earned my M.S degree in Biostatistics from Columbia University, B.A degree in Data Science and B.S degree in Brain and Cognitive Science, Summa Cum Laude, from the University of Rochester (Meliora!). <br><br>

You can explore some of the **projects** I did previously. 

For my **researching and teaching** experience, please click the *Experience tab* on the top right. 

In my free time, I enjoy food hunting and making journals. I uploaded some of my **journals** about NYC restaurants to the *Paula's fWUd tab*. 

Enjoy exploring! <br><br>
